How to contact me
=================

I'm fairly actively maintaining some of my :doc:`software projects <software>`.
If you landed here because of those, go on and open bug reports or feature
requests; I try to answer quickly to those.

If you found me because of some of my :doc:`research publications <papers>`, my
``@stanford.edu`` email is still active; feel free to message me about
clarifications, ideas, or collaboration proposals.
