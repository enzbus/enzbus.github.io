Short Biography
===============

I was born and grew up in northern Italy. I started my university studies at
the `Scuola Normale <https://www.sns.it>`_ of Pisa, Italy, where I followed a
program of physics and mathematics. During that time I was also at `CERN
<https://www.cern.int>`_ in Geneva, Switzerland as a student researcher. There
I first learnt about mathematical optimization.

As I continued my studies I decided to switch focus to applied mathematics
and finance. I joined a quantitative research desk at a major global bank in
London, UK right after graduating.

I later moved to Stanford, California to start a PhD program in the `Management
Science and Engineering <https://msande.stanford.edu/>`_ department. Its
founder `David Luenberger <https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-luenberger>`_
was my first advisor.
