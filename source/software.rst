Software
========

*Work in progress.*

This is a selection of free software projects I developed. More or less in
order of how active I am in them:

- ``cvxportfolio`` (`website <https://www.cvxportfolio.com>`_), a library for portfolio optimization and back-testing
- (codename) ``project_euromir``, prototype of a factorization-free conic solver
- ``tsar``, a library for high dimensional time-series auto regression
- ``cone_prog_refine``, iterative refinement of conic program solution vectors
- ``kelly_code``, risk-constrained Kelly portfolio allocation
- ``vwap_opt_exec``, volume-weighted average price optimal execution
- ``boolprob``, fitting boolean joint distributions for credit default modeling

I also contributed to projects developed by other people mostly at Stanford.
More or less in order of the weight of my contributions:

- ``dynamic_energy_management``
- ``cvxpy``
- ``scs``
- ...
